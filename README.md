# MiniScript Demo

This is an unfinished prototype of the [MiniScript RFC](https://github.com/edbentley/miniscript-rfc). 90% of the features are missing or not implemented the same as the spec.

There are also lots of bugs! This demo only provides some cherry-picked examples to give you a preview of how the language could work.
