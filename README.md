# MiniScript Demo

https://miniscript-demo.netlify.app

This is an unfinished prototype of the [MiniScript RFC](https://github.com/edbentley/miniscript-rfc) in an interactive editor. You can hover over variables to see their inferred type.

90% of the features are missing or not implemented the same as the spec. There are also lots of bugs! This demo only provides some cherry-picked examples to give you a preview of how the language could work.

The prototype's source code can also be seen in [`src/miniscript`](https://github.com/edbentley/miniscript-demo/tree/main/src/miniscript).
